# Taster Day Webpage

A single webpage built with HTML, styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Intro

The purpose of this webpage is to demonstrate my skills as a front-end developer using the framework Tailwind CSS.
I have been given clear instructions and a design template to follow.
Given that the project is built with HTML only there are no re-usable components extracted - all sections are created in index.html. There are many elements using the same styling classes on the webpage. As a result these styles are extracted to tailwind.css where they extend the base components of Tailwind CSS. This is to increase code readability.
